"body"=>"Something about the appearance and use\r\nof the steel helmets recently provided for\r\nthe use of the British soldiers in trenches\r\nis told by Mr. Valentine Williams in the\r\n\"Standard.\" The British helmet, he says,\r\nis perfectly plain, not decorative like the\r\nFrench, with its grenade crest and ridged\r\ncrown, and in shape resembles a pudding\r\nbasin. It is lined with soft leather. It is\r\nnot very heavy, and I know by personal\r\nexperience that it is extremely warm. In  \r\nthe recent spell of cold wet weather it kept\r\nthe head warm and the face dry. The men are\r\ndelighted with the new helmet. It certainly\r\ngives the wearer an added sense of security\r\nagainst hand grenade and shell splinters\r\nand shrapnel bullets. I am informed that\r\nin one section of the trenches in four days\r\nno fewer than 30 men were saved head\r\nwounds by their helmets. The steel helmet\r\nlends an indescribably bizarre air to the\r\nmen, who are already adjusting their uni-\r\nform to the growing rigours of the atrocious\r\nclimate of these parts. When they wear\r\nthe new steel cap, as I have seen them, over\r\na Balaclava woollen helmet covering ears\r\nand head, they look like Crusaders. But\r\nthe psychological importance of the steel\r\nhelmet, in increasing the sense of security\r\nof the wearer, is so undeniably important\r\nthat it is to be hoped that no time will be\r\nlost in serving out these caps to every man\r\nin the trenches. They undoubtedly afford  \r\nprotection against hand grenades, and so\r\nlong as trench warfare continues the British\r\nsoldier must be a grenadier as well as a\r\nrifleman. The hand grenade played an enor-\r\nmous role in the recent battles on the west-\r\nern front, and the number of these imple-\r\nments of warfare used was positively pro-\r\ndigious. The Briton is naturally a good\r\nand accurate thrower, though the hand\r\ngrenade is not flung like a cricket ball, but\r\ntossed something after the fashion of \"put-\r\nting the weight.\" Amazing efficiency in  \r\ngrenade throwing has been achieved by in-\r\ndividual men after a short course of  \r\ntraining, and it may be justifiably ex-\r\npected that if grenade throwing were hence-  \r\nforth included in the training of the new\r\narmies at home a very high standard of ex-\r\ncellence would be reached by every man in\r\nthe firing line.

Two con-\r\nstables were accordingly despatched to arrest\r\nO'Brien, who had in the meantime made his    \r\nescape from the house and secreted himself.\r\nThe constables falling to find him, Sergeant\r\nRoutledge went in search, and whilst pass-\r\ning by an archway near the Mile-end Hotel,    \r\ntho man, who was concealed behind the\r\nwall, rushed at the sergeant exclaiming,\r\n\"I'll rip you open;\" and before the ser-    \r\ngeant had time to face the man, he made\r\na blow at the sergeant's breast with a\r\nknife, but fortunately the weapon hav-\r\ning no point did not penetrate his cloth-\r\ning, although the blow almost knocked him\r\ndown. A struggle then took place between\r\nthem, and after some time the sergeant\r\nmanaged to overpower the ruffian and convey      \r\nhim to the lock-up. In the meantime Mrs  \r\nO'Brien's injuries were attended to, but the    \r\npoor woman is in a very weak state from\r\npain and loss of blood."

"body"=>"THE MURDERER DECLARED INSANE.\r\n\r\nJohn Macnamara, a labourer, aged 40, was\r\nplaced on his trial yesterday at the Criminal\r\nSittings of the Supreme Court, before his\r\nHonour Mr Justice Hodges, on the charge  \r\nof having murdered Robert George Fry, a\r\nlabourer, at Pakenham, on the morning of\r\nthe 21st August last.\r\n\r\nMr R Walsh was Crown prosecutor in\r\nthe case, and Mr Forlonge defended the\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nThe case for the prosecution was that Fry,\r\nwho was a labourer, 32 years of age, was at\r\nBourke's Pakenham Hotel, Pakenham, be-\r\ntween 4 and 5 o'clock on the afternoon of the\r\n20th August, and then appeared to be unwell.\r\n\r\nHe was advised to go to a hut which was at\r\nthe back of the hotel, in which the prisoner\r\nresided, or to go home, and he went to the hut.  \r\nOn the next day, between 1 and 2 o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon, Fry was found in the hut,\r\ndead. He had apparently been brutally\r\nmurdered, as his face was quite smashed in,\r\nand all the bones of it were broken. There\r\nwas also a very large quantity of blood on\r\nthe floor of the hut, and a \"slasher,\" or  \r\nkind ot billhook used in clearing scrub, was\r\nfound in the hut. There were both blood\r\nand hair adhering to the slasher. The medi-  \r\ncal evidence was that the deceased expired\r\nfrom loss of blood coming from the wounds ;\r\nand that it was most probable that the\r\nwounds were inflicted by the slasher. The\r\nprisoner was at an hotel at Pakenham on\r\nthe night before the murder, and he was in  \r\nanother hotel at Pakenham between 6 and  \r\n7 o'clock on the morning of the 21st ult,  \r\nand then had a glass of brandy, and\r\nshortly before 8 o'clock on the same  \r\nmorning he was seen coming away\r\nfrom the hut. He went to a store, and also\r\nto an hotel, and it was noticed that there\r\nwere marks of blood about him, and several\r\npeople also noticed that he appeared de-\r\nmented, and talked to himself, and made\r\nvarious observations which could only be\r\nuttered by a man who was not in his right\r\nmind. After the murder was discovered\r\nConstable Mills started in search of the\r\nprisoner, who had a little dog with him, and\r\nhe traced him during the afternoon of the\r\n21st ult on to within half a mile of\r\nDandenong, or a distance of about 16 miles  \r\nfrom Pakenham. Mills arrested the prisoner\r\nand told him the charge, and he said he was\r\ninnocent of it. Mills then asked him where\r\nhe got the spots of blood that were on him,\r\nand he first said that he was not a fool, and\r\nwould not make a statement ; and then that\r\nhe had been fighting with a man at Paken\r\nham. When the prisoner was searched, £1\r\n13s in silver was found on him. There  \r\nwas no money whatever on the body\r\nof the deceased when it was discovered.\r\nDr. W. H. James, who made the post-mortem  \r\nand also examined the prisoner on the 23rd  \r\nof August, said the latter then appeared\r\nquite rational, and did not show any delusion\r\nor signs of delirium tremens. It was, how-\r\never in his opinion, possible for a person to\r\nhave been suffering from the effects of\r\nalcohol about the time the murder was com-\r\nmitted, and to have recovered from the\r\neffects when he saw the prisoner.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the evidence for the prose-\r\ncution, Mr. Forlonge stated that he proposed\r\nto call several witnesses for the defence. He\r\nthen called\r\n\r\nDr. Timothy Burnett Ryan, who said that\r\nin 1886 he was deputy medical superinten-\r\ndent of the Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum.\r\nThe prisoner was admitted to the asylum in  \r\nJuly, 1886, suffering from mania. At first\r\nhe talked to himself a good deal, and kept to\r\nhimself very much. After a couple of months\r\nhe improved, and then was allowed to go on\r\nthe Yarra Bend farm, and eventually to leave\r\nthe asylum. The prisoner was never violent\r\nor dangerous, but it was witness's opinion  \r\nthat he would most probably be dangerous if\r\nhe took any drink. There was a latent form\r\nof insanity in the prisoner which simply re-  \r\nquired drink to develop it.\r\n\r\nHis Honour then asked the Crown prose-\r\ncutor whether he thought it was any use\r\ngoing farther with the case, as the jury\r\nwould be tolerably certain, after the evidence\r\nwhich had been given, to find that the\r\nprisoner was insane.\r\n\r\nMr. Walsh said he quite concurred in the\r\nview just stated by his Honour, and that he\r\nthought it was no use going on any farther\r\nwith the case.\r\n\r\nHis HONOUR, addressing the jury, then\r\nsaid that he did not think there was any\r\ndoubt that the unfortunate man in the dock\r\nwas the man who had killed Fry ; but the\r\nlaw said that if he did so when he was\r\nin a state of mind in which he did\r\nnot know what be was doing, he was not\r\nguilty of the crime of murder. What the\r\njury had to do in a case of this kind was to\r\nsay that the prisoner was not guilty on the\r\nground of insanity. It was not for them to\r\nsay merely that the prisoner was not guilty,\r\nbecause that would let out immediately at\r\nliberty a man who would be a danger to the  \r\npublic. After they brought in a verdict in\r\nthe form he had indicated, it would be his\r\nduty to make an order for the detention of  \r\nthe prisoner until such time as the Governor\r\nin Council thought it safe to do something\r\nelse with him. Of course, if the jury thought\r\nthe prisoner did not do the act, they would\r\nfind him not guilty, but he (the judge) did\r\nnot think that, as reasonable men, they could  \r\nentertain any doubt that the prisoner, when\r\nin the state which had been described-when  \r\nhe was talking about his dog studying\r\nastronomy, and about seeing thousands\r\nof devils, and when he was punching\r\na telegraph post-was not in his right\r\nmind, and that he was not so when he\r\nmurdered Fry He (the prisoner) was not\r\nthen responsible for his acts, and therefore\r\nit would be both law and justice if the jury\r\nfound a verdict of not guilty on the ground\r\nof insanity. That could be almost the only  \r\nverdict they could have any justification in\r\nfinding. Of course that would be taking a\r\nmerciful view of the case, because it would\r\nnot subject the prisoner to the punishment\r\nfor a capital offence. It was only saying the\r\nman did the act ; but, that as he did it when\r\nhe was not in a right state of mind, he should\r\nbe taken care of until it was known that he\r\ncould be set at large with safety to himself\r\nand to the public\r\n\r\nThe jury after retiring a few minutes re-  \r\nturned into court with a verdict of not guilty\r\non the ground of insanity.\r\n\r\nHis Honour then ordered that the prisoner\r\nshould be kept in strict custody ni the Mel-\r\nbourne gaol until the pleasure of His Ex-\r\ncellency respecting him was known.\r\n\r\nThe Court at its rising adjourned until this  \r\nmorning"

After\r\nbeating her head until he thought he had\r\nkilled her, he hurried to the railway station\r\nclose by, and threw himself under the\r\nwheels of a railway train. Duff, with his  \r\nright leg amputated, now lies in a dangerous\r\ncondition in the Melbourne Hospital, while\r\nhis wife, who seems likely to recover, is still    \r\nat her home.  \r\n\r\nBetween half past 8 and 9 o'clock yester-  \r\nday morning, Joseph Duff - who is well\r\nknown in Auburn - was seen by several per-\r\nsons in the vicinity of the railway station.  \r\nAs subsequent inquiries showed, he had\r\nbreakfasted at home, and after announcing\r\nhis intention of going to work, be had visi-\r\nted his mother - who lives near by - and\r\nthen had gone to the railway station. Just\r\nbefore 9 o'clock however, he left the vi-\r\ncinity of the station, and went homeward.\r\nAt 10 minutes past 9 he again approached\r\nthe station, and passed Constable Lewis,\r\nwalking at a steady pace. \"Good morn-  \r\ning\" said the constable, and Duff answered      \r\nhis greeting without anything unusual in\r\nhis manner. He walked upon the platform\r\nfor outward trains from Melbourne, passing\r\nthe stationmaster and a youth named Henry  \r\nThompson; and then, going quickly to the\r\nMelbourne end of the platform, he waited\r\non the kerb. The 8.55 down train - due at\r\nAuburn at 9.13 - was just coming in, and\r\nwhen it was within a few yards of him he  \r\nleapt in front of the train and was run\r\nover.  \r\n\r\nThe driver of the train was Samuel Tar-\r\nrant. His train had just passed the gates  \r\non the city side of the railway station, and\r\nhe had shut off steam, when he caught sight  \r\nof the man standing on the kerbing. \"I  \r\nwatched him,\" he said, \"and while I\r\nwatched him he looked round, and I caught\r\nhis eye. Then he suddenly threw up his\r\nhead and jumped. It's hard to judge dis-\r\ntance when you're on a moving train; but\r\nI reckoned that he jumped about 10ft. from\r\nthe engine. I put the brakes on as hard\r\nas I could, but the carriages passed over\r\nhim, and as soon as we stopped I jumped\r\ndown to see what had become of him. The\r\nfireman on the engine saw nothing, and\r\nneither he nor the stationmaster knew why  \r\nI pulled up so short.\r\n\r\n\"I got to the railway line, and saw the\r\nman lying under a carriage. He was con-\r\nscious, and looked at me. 'What are you\r\ndoing?' I said. 'Only having a lay down,'\r\nhe said to me. I commenced to crawl under\r\nthe carriage to help him out; but while I\r\nwas going in one way he dragged himself\r\nbetween the wheels into the 6ft.-way, and  \r\nby the time the stationmaster got down he  \r\nwas lying out there, with his right leg just\r\nhanging from him, under the knee. The\r\nstationmaster and I lifted him out on to\r\nthe platform, and somebody went for the\r\npolice.\"  \r\n\r\nConstable Lewis, who was still on duty\r\nnear the railway station, arrived just after\r\nthe man had been lifted to the platform,\r\nand Duff recognised him. \"I done it,\" cried  \r\nDuff. \"What?\" asked the constable. \"I\r\nchucked myself under the train,\" answered    \r\nDuff. \"But I feared death, I feared death,\"  \r\nand he began to ramble incoherently. Then\r\nhe looked at the constable again. \"I have    \r\nmurdered my wife,\" he said, \"I murdered\r\nher, and kissed her goodbye.\" Lewis was\r\naghast. \"Yes, I have murdered her.\" Duff      \r\nrepeated, \"but I fear death. I fear death.\"    \r\nWithout waiting to listen to more, the      \r\nconstable summoned Dr Scott, who lives in  \r\nAuburn road, close to the Auburn rail-\r\nway station. Dr Scott came down, and  \r\nstopped the hemorrhage from the man's leg,    \r\nwhich was almost cut off. Just at that\r\ntime an inward train to Melbourne hap-\r\npened to be due, and Duff was placed in\r\nthe guard's van, and taken by Lewis to the\r\nMelbourne Hospital. On the way he con-\r\ntinued a rambling talk, occasionally speak-\r\ning of his wife. \"I wish I had managed to\r\nmake an end of myself, too,\" he said. On\r\nthe way to Melbourne, he drew a cigarette-\r\ncase from his pocket, and, lighting a cigar-\r\nette, he smoked it with evident relish.\r\n\r\nEVENTS AT THE HOUSE  \r\n\r\nBefore leaving Auburn, Constable Lewis\r\nhas sent a telephone message to Sergeant\r\nDaly of Auburn, reporting Duff's state-\r\nments with regard to his wife. Sergeant\r\nDaly went to the place, but found Ser-\r\ngeant Hibberd and Constable M'Kenzie (of    \r\nHawthorn) already there. They had been\r\ncalled by telephone by a man named Bar-\r\nnard, who had been sent from the house\r\nin search of assistance. Dr Scott, also, had  \r\ngone to Malmsbury street, as soon as the\r\ntrain left for Melbourne, carrying Lewis and    \r\nDuff to the Hospital. Sergeant Hibberd\r\nfound at once that, although Duff had\r\nseriously injured his wife, he has not killed\r\nher. His inquiries showed plainly that\r\nDuff's attack upon his wife had been quite\r\nmotiveless, and had been the result of the\r\nbreaking into insanity of a mind which for\r\nsome time had been regarded as weak.\r\n\r\nFor months Joseph Duff had been\r\n\"queer,\" and filled with an intense fear of  \r\ndeath. During the past two months his\r\nstrangeness of manner had been particularly  \r\nnoticeable, and his father - in whose com-\r\npany he had always found comfort and rest  \r\n-had slept at his house every night for six\r\nweeks. His brother and his sister-in-law    \r\nlived at the house next door, so that he was  \r\nalways amongst his relatives. Of late he\r\nhad not drunk to excess, but he was an\r\ninveterate cigarette smoker. Yesterday    \r\nmorning, after breakfasting with his son,\r\nthe father left the house, but at 9 o'clock\r\nhe returned. His wife, Mary Duff, was\r\nlying in bed with her two-days-old son (the    \r\nfourth child of the marriage), and her sis-  \r\nter-in-law - Mrs May Duff - was in the kit-\r\nchen. Suddenly the woman in the kitchen\r\nheard her sister-in-law crying out. She    \r\nran to the bedroom and saw Duff holding\r\nhis wife and brandishing an axe in his  \r\nhand. She closed with him, and though\r\nDuff is a powerfully built man, of medium\r\nheight, she succeeded in getting the axe\r\naway from him, and throwing it out of  \r\nhis reach. A fire had been lit in the room,\r\nand Duff, deprived of his axe, took from\r\nthe fireplace a billet of hard boxwood, 1ft\r\nin length and about 4in by 2in in cross\r\nsection. Holding this weapon in his hand\r\nhe dragged his wife out of bed and struck\r\nher several times. His sister-in-law again    \r\nattacked him, but could not take the piece\r\nof wood away. Having failed to do this\r\nshe ran out to look for assistance. He fol-\r\nlowed her immediately afterwards, and,\r\npausing at the gate, he said to her, \"I have  \r\nmurdered Mary, so that no one may have  \r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nSergeant Hibberd found the injured\r\nwoman quite conscious, and able to speak.  \r\n\"My husband came into the room with an    \r\naxe in his hand. He did not speak, but\r\nraised the axe, and stood over me with it.\r\nI called out for my sister-in-law, who was          \r\nin the back of the house, and he went out\r\ninto the passage; but, seeing her, he ran\r\nback, and struck me on the head over and\r\nover again. After he had struck me, he  \r\nleaned over me, kissed me, and said, 'Good-\r\nbye.'\"\r\n\r\nCONDITION OF THE PATIENTS.  \r\n\r\nDr Scott made a careful examination of\r\nMrs. Duff's wounds. There were three of\r\nthem, all inflicted by the billet of wood -\r\nsplinters of which were sticking into her\r\nhead - but, although her scalp was lacerated\r\nand she had lost a great deal of blood, her  \r\nskull had not been fractured. She developed  \r\nno dangerous symptoms yesterday, and is\r\nlikely to recover. In accordance with the\r\nwish of her relatives, and under the advice\r\nof Dr Scott, she was not taken to the  \r\nHospital; but remained at home in the\r\ncare of her sister-in-law and a trained    \r\nnurse.  \r\n\r\nDuff was admitted to the Melbourne Hos-\r\npital immediately on his arrival, and his  \r\nleg was amputated by Mr Charles Ryan.\r\nIn addition to the injury to his leg, there\r\nwas an abrasion on the bridge of his nose\r\n- either caused by a blow from some part\r\nof the train, or by his fall. His condition\r\nduring the afternoon and evening was ex-\r\ntremely dangerous.\r\n\r\nSPECTATOR'S ACCOUNT.      \r\n\r\nMr. H .J. M. Thompson, son of Mr. Max-\r\nwell Thompson, of 317 Collins-street, who  \r\nsaw Duff when he came to the platform,\r\nmade the following statement: - \"I was\r\nstanding on the 'up' platform waiting for\r\na train to take me to Melbourne, when I  \r\nsaw a man on the opposite platform. There\r\nwas nothing special in his demeanour to at-\r\ntract my attention and I took no more\r\nnotice of him than one usually gives to the\r\nperson whom be sees on a railway station.\r\nThe train from Melbourne was coming in to\r\nthe opposite platform. The engine was\r\npuffing, and altogether the train made a\r\ngood deal of noise. It is difficult to believe\r\nthat anyone could have failed to hear it. I  \r\nnoticed that the man walked to the front  \r\nof the platform, and although I knew that\r\nhe was dangerously close, I naturally\r\nthought he would step back as the train\r\ndrew nearer. Just as the trains was com-\r\ning through the gates, however, Duff\r\nstooped, and, resting himself on his hand,\r\njumped to the line. The whole incident\r\nwas, of course, only a matter of seconds,\r\nbut, as far as I could judge, the man ap-\r\npeared to be quite regardless of whether\r\nthere was a train on the line. On reach-\r\ning the line, however, he paused momen-  \r\ntarily, and seemed to be awaiting the ap-\r\nproach of the train. Just as it bore down  \r\nupon him, however, Duff sprang, but, as\r\nyou know, he was too late. The engine\r\nseemed to me to go right over him, but just\r\nat that moment the train in which I in-\r\ntended to travel came in, and I was shut\r\nout from seeing the succeeding incidents. I\r\ndid not get into the Melbourne train, as\r\nI thought it only right to see the thing\r\nthrough. When the Melbourne train left I\r\nsaw Duff was in charge of the officials, and\r\nI came on by the next train to Mel-\r\nbourne.\"  "

"body"=>"JEALOUSY NOT THE MOTIVE.\r\n\r\nDELIBERATE MURDER.\r\n\r\nAN INSANE LETTER.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances surrounding the mur-\r\nder of the girl Rose Normoyle by a youth\r\nnamed Bertram Gordon, who afterwards\r\ncommitted suicide, becomes all the more\r\nmysterious as the investigation progresses.          \r\nThe residents of South Yan Yean, where\r\nthe tragedy occurred on Saturday evening  \r\nlast, were generally acquainted with both  \r\nparties, but until Sunday few of them were  \r\naware of the relations which had existed\r\nbetween Gordon and Mary Normoyle, the      \r\nelder sister of the dead girl. The motives\r\nthat impelled the young man to commit  \r\nthis crime are still a matter of conjecture,\r\nbut it is tolerably certain that the infer-  \r\nence of an attachment between Gordon and        \r\nRose Normoyle was wholly unfounded.  \r\nNot a scrap of evidence has been dis-\r\ncovered to indicate that the youth had at\r\nany time exhibited any signs of love to-\r\nwards the younger girl; and on her side, it\r\nis manifest that she felt nothing but dis-\r\ngust and repugnance towards the young    \r\nman, who, she said, had temporised and  \r\nbroken the promises to marry her sister    \r\nMary.\r\n\r\nNeither of the principals were natives of      \r\nthe district, though the families of both\r\nhave been long connected with Yan Yean.\r\nMrs. Giddens, sen., and Mrs. Underwood,  \r\nthe respective grandmothers of the girl and  \r\nher murderer, live within a few yards of\r\neach other, and from childhood the\r\nmothers of the ill-fated couple have been  \r\non terms of friendship. Over two years      \r\nago Rose Normoyle first entered the em-    \r\nployment of Mr. Sutherland, L.R.C.S., but      \r\nabout three months ago she left his service  \r\ntemporarily to act as a companion to her      \r\nsister, Violet, who was in Melbourne under  \r\nthe care of an oculist. At her re-  \r\nquest her sister Mary was then  \r\npermitted to fill the vacant position,  \r\nbut after a few weeks, Mary's continued    \r\nsickness excited the suspicions of her aunt,    \r\nMrs. Albert Edwards, the wife of a farmer  \r\nin the locality. The girl at first stoutly  \r\nprotested her innocence, but eventually ad-  \r\nmitted to Mrs. Edwards that Bertram Gor-      \r\ndon was her lover, and had pledged his        \r\nword to make her his wife. Mrs. Edwards  \r\npromptly communicated with Rose Nor-    \r\nmolye, who returned to Mr. Sutherland's,    \r\nand in turn sent a letter to her mother, a\r\nresident of Lyonville, informing her of the  \r\ndomestic trouble. Mrs. Normoyle visited    \r\nMelbourne at once, and exacted from young    \r\nGordon a repetition of his promise of mar-  \r\nriage. Later on she paid another visit, with            \r\nthe result that it was agreed that the mar-      \r\nriage should take place on August 25. So  \r\ndefinite were the arrangements on this occa-            \r\nsion that Rose obtained leave to attend the  \r\nwedding, and, on her return, she was too      \r\nhumiliated to tell the truth to her em-    \r\nployer, asserting that the marriage had    \r\ntaken place. To Mrs. Edwards, however,        \r\nshe confided that the youth had made the\r\nexcuse that a fine of 30/- imposed on him for      \r\nplaying pitch and toss had prevented him    \r\nfrom becoming Mary's husband on that      \r\ndate. Rose next obtained a promise from      \r\nGordon that he would marry Mary on Fri-\r\nday, September 6. On that date she accord-\r\ningly obtained leave to visit Melbourne. Call-          \r\ning at 6 Leicester-street, Fitzroy, where      \r\nMary Normoyle had been lodging for some      \r\ndays, under the name of Mrs. Gordon, she  \r\naccompanied her to the spot where Gordon        \r\nhad promised to meet them preparatory to    \r\nbeing married. The youth, however, failed            \r\nto attend, and the two girls waited in the    \r\nstreet until 2 o'clock in the afternoon, when        \r\nGordon came from the quarry with his      \r\nbrother John. A conversation ensued, and        \r\nsubsequently the sisters met Mrs. Edwards        \r\nin Brunswick-street, and told her that Rose        \r\nhad had high words with Bertram Gordon,\r\nwho had finally promised to marry Mary  \r\nat 7 o'clock the same evening. Shortly        \r\nafterwards Rose Normoyle left, and walked                \r\nto the North Fitzroy railway station,          \r\nwhere she found Gordon standing on the    \r\nplatform, and it is certain that at this          \r\ntime he must have had in his possession the    \r\ntwo revolvers which were subsequently\r\nfound. Immediately the train left, Gordon          \r\nhired a horse from a resident of Clifton  \r\nHill, and must have galloped hard all    \r\nthe way to South Yan Yean, for a few    \r\nminutes after the arrival of the train there          \r\nRose Normoyle and a girl friend were  \r\nsurprised by his galloping along the road        \r\nand drawing rein at their side. As he    \r\nspoke to Rose the other girl walked on,  \r\nand heard nothing of the conversation    \r\nwhich took place.    \r\n\r\nGordon then appears to have ridden to    \r\nthe house occupied by his grandmother,    \r\nMrs. Underwood, and his cousin, a young      \r\nwoman of about 20. There he produced\r\nhis two revolvers, and said that he had        \r\nbeen given one by an acquaintance, and    \r\nthe other by a strange man on the train.  \r\nHis relative, however, were disinclined\r\nto accept such lame stories, and after some        \r\ntime he admitted having paid 25/- for the      \r\nlarger of the two, adding that they were  \r\nfor shooting rabbits. He also said they    \r\nwould kill a man at 100 yards, and,    \r\nplacing the muzzle of one to his temple,        \r\nremarked jocularly, \"You only want to            \r\npull the trigger, and you'd be dead with-            \r\nout feeling anything.\"        \r\n\r\nDuring this stay at Mrs. Underwood's        \r\nhe seemed in good spirits and did not    \r\nrefer to the Normoyle girls or to his    \r\ntrouble. He left the house on Saturday,  \r\nspent some time drinking, and lavished        \r\nhis money freely, presenting casual ac-      \r\nquaintances with bottles of beer, packets      \r\nof cigarettes, and other trifles. Several    \r\nrevolver shots were heard during the after-  \r\nnoon, and four empty cartridge cases and\r\na dozen cartridges of the calibre of Gor-    \r\ndon's revolver have since been found on a          \r\nroad a few yards from the scene of the      \r\ntragedy, indicating that he passed some    \r\ntime practising shooting. Before 5 o'clock        \r\nhe returned to Mrs. Underwood's, and          \r\nwrote the letter which was delivered to his            \r\nfather yesterday morning, but which he            \r\nsaid he was sending to his brother in      \r\nSydney. After tea he kissed his grand-          \r\nmother good-bye, remarking that he did\r\nnot know when he would see her  \r\nagain. Not heeding the remark,      \r\nMrs. Underwood said \"God bless        \r\nyou, my boy\", and watched him        \r\ngallop from the door. Gordon rode directly      \r\nto the house of Mr. Sutherland, and ar-      \r\nranged to meet Rose later on. He then      \r\nwent to the Bridge Inn Hotel, had a few\r\ndrinks, and on emerging encountered Mr.        \r\nEdward Giddens, an uncle of the Nor-        \r\nmoyle girls. They walked together to Gil-  \r\nlian's store, where Gordon created a dis-    \r\nturbance, causing the storekeeper to order          \r\nhim to desist. He then handed his letter          \r\nand a shilling to a boy, and asked him to      \r\nstamp and post the former, telling him to      \r\nkeep the change. Giddens accompanied the            \r\nhorseman along the road for about a quar-    \r\nter of a mile, when Gordon left him and  \r\ngalloped back. He was on the platform of          \r\nthe station when the train left at 18    \r\nminutes past 8 o'clock, and gave a boy          \r\nnamed Peter McCoy money to buy some      \r\nbiscuits at the store. McCoy was told to          \r\nkeep the change, but declined to do so,        \r\nhanding over the biscuits as Rose Normoyle\r\npassed the store. She was about a chain    \r\ndistant when Gordon joined her and dis-\r\nmounted.    \r\n\r\nThis is the last seen of either alive. At\r\nabout 10 minutes to 9 o'clock three shots    \r\nwere heard, and early on Sunday morning        \r\nthe hired horse was found wandering along                  \r\nthe road with a broken bridle. Several          \r\nhours later the dead body of the girl and\r\nher dying murderer were discovered in the  \r\nroad running alongside the aqueduct to    \r\nthe Preston Reservoir. The girl's death      \r\nwas evidently instantaneous, but the won-      \r\nder is that Gordon, after he inflicted the\r\nwound upon himself, was not drowned.      \r\n\r\nWhen he fired the shot into his brain the    \r\nyouth fell on his back, his head falling into              \r\na channel three-parts full of water.        \r\n\r\nMr. Gordon, the father of the youth, had    \r\nmeanwhile become anxious regarding his      \r\nson's prolonged absence, and arrived at      \r\nSouth Yan Yean at midday. He passed  \r\nthrough the township without hearing any-        \r\nthing of the tragedy, and only learned the      \r\nterrible news on reaching the residence of  \r\nMrs. Underwood, about a mile and a half  \r\naway.  \r\n\r\nMrs. Underwood, the grandmother of      \r\nyoung Gordon, states that, while he was    \r\nalways quiet and tractable in her hands,            \r\nhe was afflicted with an ungovernable tem-          \r\nper. For the past three months she had  \r\nnoticed a complete change in his    \r\ndemeanour, and so marked did it        \r\nbecome that she had several times    \r\ndemanded to know the reason of his  \r\nmorose and preoccupied manner. Gordon  \r\nhad told Mrs. Underwood that he had of    \r\nlate been suffering from severe pains in the          \r\nhead, and that he could do nothing to cure    \r\nthem. Mrs. Underwood is inclined to be-    \r\nlieve that he spoke the truth, adding that\r\nthere was insanity in Gordon's family.          \r\n\r\nThe mother of the dead girl arrived in      \r\nthe township last evening, but was in a      \r\nstate of complete collapse, and had to be    \r\nassisted to the residence of Mrs. Edwards.          \r\nThe father is at present working in the        \r\nBeech Forest, where there is no telegraphic        \r\ncommunication, and consequently he is still        \r\nin ignorance of his daughter's fate.    \r\n\r\nYesterday morning a post-card addressed    \r\nto Rose Normoyle arrived in South Yan      \r\nYean. This missive, signed \"M.G.\", and          \r\ndated from Fitzroy, requested the girl to    \r\n\"come immediately on important business,\"              \r\nand evidently came from her sister Mary.          \r\nThe letter sent by Gordon to his father    \r\nwas delivered yesterday morning, and        \r\nreads as follows:-  \r\n\r\n\"Dear Dad. - Hope you will not worry over  \r\nBart. I would come home, but I am sick of my  \r\nlife. Yould and dead in Yane Yean, and I shott\r\nRose Normile, and intend to shott more beefoar I\r\ndone. Good-bye to (Dad), (Ned), (J. Benche),  \r\n(Aney), grandmother, and mother, Dad.  \r\n\r\nOver the leaf are scrawled the following    \r\nlines: -\r\n\r\n\"Just tell that you sowe me four I will  \r\nrite you news. Just brike the news to    \r\nmother; tell her not too wite four me. I'me\r\nnot come home. I must say thear no other to    \r\ntake the place of mother. Dad, and kiss x x x    \r\nheir swets lips four me. Brike news to her. Rote\r\n9 Stember, at grandmother's. I haveter to hurry  \r\nour the plice will have me.\"  \r\n\r\nOn the back of the letter was a rough\r\nsketch of the spot where the tragedy was to      \r\nbe enacted, the position of the river and\r\nbridge being indicated, and near at hand a  \r\ncross, underneath which is written \"Bert\r\nand horse,\"and scrawled across the page  \r\nwas the final message, \"Don't forget to tell      \r\nBob I dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter was taken charge of by John    \r\nGordon, brother of the deceased man, who  \r\nhanded it over to Mounted-Constable Carey  \r\nlast night. John Gordon stated that his\r\nmother came home yesterday from Sydney  \r\nand was overwhelmed when the shocking    \r\nnews was broken to her. It seems from  \r\nhis statement that he carried his brother's      \r\ndinner over to the quarries on Friday, and    \r\nthe men knocked off and were paid at 2    \r\no'clock. On the way home the brothers  \r\nwere met by the two Normoyle sisters, who\r\naccosted Bertram and detained him for    \r\nsome time in conversation about his inten-      \r\ntions with regard to Mary. He was much    \r\nagitated when he left them, and said that\r\nhe was going into town to see a lawyer.\r\n\r\nLater in the afternoon he announced that    \r\nhe was going to ride over to Yan Yean to    \r\nbring back a cow, and he left in an abrupt\r\nmanner, as though he intended returning\r\nthe next morning.\r\n\r\nThe body of the dead girl was conveyed\r\nyesterday to the City Morgue, where an in-\r\nquest will be held to-morrow.
